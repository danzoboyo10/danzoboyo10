## Hello👋🏼🧑🏻‍💻


I am a highly motivated and aspiring software engineer! Ever since I was young I've always had an interest in design and problem solving to help make things as efficient and clean as possible; Whether that means finding the most optimal solution to a math problem or figuring out how to land a skateboard trick in the most stylish way. It is something I strive for in everything I do. 


## What am I up to 🌱 👀 ??

As of today, I am enrolled in a software engineering immersive program with general assembly and I am absolutely loving the program. Prior to the bootcamp, I had about 5 months of experience teaching myself how to code! My self-teaching consisted of going through online courses on Java, Python, data structures and algorithms, and speaking to anyone in the field that I could connect with.
